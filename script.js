Their primary strength lies in inflicting substantial damage over an extended period. This unique feature makes them particularly adept at countering tanks equipped with heavy resistance, as the majority of their damage is based on DOT effects. By utilizing DOT damage, these weapons effectively bypass resistance, providing a strategic advantage against resilient foes. Deceiver and Damper stand out as potent choices for those seeking to overcome formidable tank defenses in the battlefield.
